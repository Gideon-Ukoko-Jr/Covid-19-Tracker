# Covid-19-Tracker
This is a Coronavirus Tracker Web Application which reports the total number of reported Covid-19 cases in a particular country and the changes in cases reported since the previous day.
<br>
I built the Web App with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. 
<br>
The data source is provided by <b>John Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering</b> (JHU CSSE)
